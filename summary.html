        <p>
           I am currently enrolled as a Honors Finance major at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. In my spare time I am currently becoming a coder/ web developer in hopes of designing apps and websites for businesses in the future. I have a people-first mind that allwos me to build strong connections with those around me. I have an urge to perfect every skill that I pick up. I do not settle for less becasue I know that most plans come to fruition when there is enough effort. I have always enjoyed building others up and I attempt to always have a smile on my face. I love winning and will always do my best to achieve success in all aspects of my life.
